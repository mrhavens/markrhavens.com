# Mark R. Havens Online Teaching Profile

This Github repository serves as the version controlled home of [my online teaching profile](https://markrhavens.com).

I have recently been playing with a new theme for this profile, named [hugo-theme-shell](https://github.com/Yukuro/hugo-theme-shell). This theme was designed to emulate the look and feel of a Linux terminal, and I found it to be a unique and interesting approach for showcasing my teaching profile and announcing my tech classes to my students.

However, after spending some time with the theme, I've come to the conclusion that it may not be the best fit for my needs as a blogger. The theme does not seem to have any built-in image handling capabilities, which is an important aspect of my blogging process. While I can add images to my markdown files, the lack of image processing tools means that I would not be able to resize or position my images effectively.

There's no tag support. Which is fine for profile purposes.

I also noticed that there was a glitch in the directory handling of multiple posts. The default handling put the directroy titles in upper case, and somehow made it plurl by adding an 's' to the end. This was bothersome, and while I could have spent a few hours trying to fix it, a decided to work around the problem by using '_index.md' to override the directory names. This worked pretty well, and I'm happy with the results.

In light of these limitations, I have decided to use this theme primarily as a profile page, with limited introductions to other topics that will be covered in more detail elsewhere. Despite this, I still believe that the theme is a cool concept, and I hope that it will attract technically-minded individuals to my classes.
